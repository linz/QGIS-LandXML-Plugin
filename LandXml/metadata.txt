description=Import parcels and nodes from a LINZ LandXml file
about=The LandXml format is an Xml format used to transfer cadastral survey data.
  The format can describe cadastral survey parcels, nodes, and observations.  
  This plugin is used to extract information from a LandXml data file into
  memory layers in the QGIS plugin.  Currently it supports parcels and 
  nodes, and observations. 
  The plugin is designed to work with LandXml files generated by the
  Land Information New Zealand Landonline application - it may not support
  LandXml from other sources.
