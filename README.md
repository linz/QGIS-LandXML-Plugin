# QGIS LandXML Plugin

Land Information New Zealand LandXML importer for QGIS. Import parcels and marks from a LINZ Landonline LandXml file

The imported data are loaded into memory layers.  It is recommended that you install the MemoryLayerSaver plugin so that 
the data are preserved when the project is saved.  Alternatively you can save the data from QGIS to a persistent format 
after it has been loaded.
